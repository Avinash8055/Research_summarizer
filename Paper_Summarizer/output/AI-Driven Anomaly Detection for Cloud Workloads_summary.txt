Summary:
Implementing an AI-driven anomaly detection system for cloud workloads involves several stages, from data collection and preprocessing to model development, deployment, and continuous monitoring. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide for this project. Deep Learning Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Useful for anomaly detection in structured data. Time Series Data: Since cloud workloads are continuous, treat the data as time-series data for temporal anomaly detection. Isolation Forest: A tree-based model useful for detecting outliers. One-Class SVM: Can identify anomalies in high-dimensional data. Use dynamic thresholds (based on moving averages or statistical models) or predefined thresholds for anomaly detection. When an anomaly is detected, trigger alerts via cloud-native alerting mechanisms. Integrate with SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack) to send alerts and generate logs for audit and compliance.
