This literature survey examines the current state of AI-driven anomaly detection. It explores key methodologies, including supervised and unsupervised ML. It also explores practical considerations such as scalability, real-time detection, and system integration. It concludes with a list of the top 10 trends in the field of AI. The search was designed to identify studies that align with the inclusion criteria. The selection process involved a number of steps. The search was also designed to ensure that the results were representative of the entire field of study. The results of the search were then compiled into a report. The report was released on Monday. Papers presenting empirical evidence were prioritized over theoretical or conceptual studies. Data collection included the type of dataset used, as well as the experimental setup. Data analysis included the number of data points and the time it took to process a data point. The study looked at more than 150 studies on the subject. It also looked at how the research was done and how it was applied to the real world. The study was published in the open-source journal Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity. It is the first of its kind. The study looked at the different approaches to anomaly detection in the cloud. It also looked at how the technology could be applied in the real world. The study also looked into the potential for the technology to be used in the future. It was also used to assess the potential impact of the technology on the cloud economy. Despite their advantages, AI-driven approaches face notable criticisms and challenges. High computational requirements can strain resources, particularly in real-time environments. Federated learning offers a promising path by enabling collaborative training across distributed systems without sharing sensitive data. It can also be used to improve the overall performance of a system. By proactively managing anomalies, businesses can enhance operational reliability, maintain user trust, and safeguard sensitive data. Looking ahead, advancements in areas like federated learning, explainable AI (XAI), and edge computing are set to elevate the effectiveness of these systems. The Role of AI in Anomaly Detection.
